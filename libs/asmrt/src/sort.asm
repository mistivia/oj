; sort.asm -- generic in-place sort, custom ABI (like libc's qsort)
;
; sort(base, nmemb, size, cmpFn)
;   base  -- pointer to the first element of the array
;   nmemb -- number of elements
;   size  -- size of one element, in bytes (elements are opaque byte
;            blobs to sort -- it never inspects them itself, only calls
;            cmpFn and swaps raw bytes)
;   cmpFn -- pointer to a custom-ABI comparator cmpFn(a, b), where a/b
;            are pointers to two elements; returns (in rax) a value <0
;            if *a should sort before *b, 0 if equal, >0 if *a should
;            sort after *b -- same contract as libc's qsort comparator,
;            just called through this runtime's own ABI (pushed args,
;            ret N) instead of the real System V one.
;            (Named cmpFn, not cmp, so args's %$cmpFn alias doesn't
;            collide with the x86 `cmp` instruction mnemonic.)
;
; Implementation is recursive quicksort (Lomuto partition, last element
; as pivot). sort() *is* the recursive step -- there's no separate
; "sort a [lo,hi] index range" helper: a sub-array is just another
; (base, nmemb) pair, so recursing means calling sort() again with base
; moved forward by (p+1)*size elements and nmemb shrunk to match, not
; tracking a pair of indices into the original array.
;
; partition()/swapElems() are internal (not `global`) -- nothing outside
; this file calls them directly, so they're not declared in asmrt.inc
; either. Every one of them still follows the same custom ABI as any
; exported function, recursive calls included: the pivot index p, which
; must survive the call to partition(), lives in a `local` slot, never a
; register.
;
; Naive last-element-as-pivot quicksort degrades to O(n) recursion depth
; (and O(n^2) time) on already-sorted or reverse-sorted input -- a known
; limitation of the simplest textbook version, left as-is here in
; keeping with this runtime's teaching/experiment scope over robustness.
